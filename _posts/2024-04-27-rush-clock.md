## What does it do?

If you didn't figure out (or you simply missed) mystery clock on my [last post]({% post_url 2024-04-24-this-is-not-an-ordinary-clock %}), read along to discover how it works and what more can you do with it.

It ticks faster at the beginning of the **rush period** and slower towards the end of the **rush period**.

The default **rush period** is **hourly**, meaning it will start ticking faster at the beginning of the hour and slower towards the end of the hour.

Other than **hourly**, there are **daily** and **custom** **rush periods**.
